about me
======
Starting from May 2021, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher and assistant researcher at the School of Computer Science (School of Software and School of Intelligent Science and Technology) of Sichuan University. From April 2015 to June 2020, I worked as a full-time researcher at Klaustal University of Technology/Lower Saxony Energy Research Center in Germany. Professor Feng Wentao has been engaged in research on computer simulation methods, simulation modeling related to the energy industry, and practical applications of computer simulation in the engineering field. He is also engaged in research on multi view learning and deep learning based simulation modeling of complex physical systems. At present, nearly 30 papers have been published in authoritative international and domestic academic journals and international conferences, including 13 papers indexed by SCI; Publish two academic monographs in English/German; 8 national patents have been applied for, and 3 have been authorized; Responsible for and participated in a total of 12 vertical and horizontal projects at all levels in China and Germany; I am a reviewer for five international authoritative academic journals, including TNNLS.


Honors for project achievements
======
Professor Feng Wentao has made significant contributions in modeling deep energy development based on hydraulic fracturing, engineering applications of multi-stage fracturing in geothermal resource development, and strategic planning for reducing and enhancing seismic risks in geothermal systems. His research results have been applied to the large-scale geothermal research project MAGS2 funded by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) in Germany and the DGMK-680 series project funded by the German Association for Sustainable Energy Carriers, Transportation, and Carbon Cycle (DGMK). The industrial intelligence methods and technologies for nuclear industry scenarios that were involved in the research have also been applied to engineering projects under China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC)

**Schönen guten Tag!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;祝您度过美好的一天！&nbsp;Have a good day!**

Prof. Dr.-Ing. Wentao Feng has significantly contributed to intelligent simulation, multi-view learning, the modeling of deep energy development based on hydraulic fracturing, engineering applications of multi-stage fracturing in geothermal resource development, and strategic planning for reducing and enhancing seismic risks in geothermal systems. His research results have been applied to the large-scale geothermal research project MAGS2 funded by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) in Germany and the DGMK-680 series project financed by the DGMK German Society for Sustainable Energy Carriers, Mobility and Carbon Cycles e.V. The industrial intelligence methods and technologies for nuclear industry scenarios that were involved in the research have also been applied to engineering projects under China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC).
